This project was built for Alona Goldberg's (my sister) art show in TLV. It is a node app that runs on Raspberry Pi.
It monitors specific twitter accounts (e.g Kim Kardashian), then it converts the text messages to morse code which used to light different parts of the exhibit .

Setup:
---
```
$npm install -g grunt-cli
$npm install
```
Create `credentials.json` with your twitter credentials based on the template in `credentials.example.json`

Run:
---
```
$ grunt
```
